Hi, my name is Max Gonzih.

I'm software/hardware [hacker](http://paulgraham.com/gba.html) with passion for technology.

My favorite editor is Vim.
I'm familiar with many programming languages, but have most fun working with Ruby, Scheme and Clojure.
On every newly installed system I always do `setxkbmap 'us(dvp)'`.
All my machines run linux.
I love embed systems and virtualization technologies, they are like some kind of small pets.

I hope you will enjoy or find helpful information on this site.
