Hi, my name is Max Gonzih.

I'm software developer with passion for technology.

My favorite editor is Vim.
I'm familiar with many programming languages, but have most fun working with Ruby, Scheme and Clojure.
On every newly installed system I always do `setxkbmap 'us(dvp)'`.
All my machines run linux.
I love to hack embed systems.

I hope you will enjoy or find helpful information on this site.
